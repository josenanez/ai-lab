*by [JoseNanez.com](https://www.josenanez.com) ‚Äî Strategy, Ethics & Intelligent Execution*

Welcome to **AI-LAB**, the applied AI lab of JoseNanez.com, a consulting firm that helps organizations **translate strategy into working AI solutions**.

This repository is part of our [Applied AI ¬∑ XAI](https://www.josenanez.com/verticales/xai) vertical and contains practical agents, frameworks, and tools to automate real business challenges ‚Äî ethically and at scale.

## üéØ Purpose ¬∑ From Strategy to Code

AI-LAB exists to turn strategic decisions into real, working AI solutions.

> "Applied AI is only valuable if it aligns with business, ethics, and execution."


Our goal is to help organizations and innovation teams **design, build, and deploy applied AI**‚Äîfrom early discovery to production-ready systems‚Äîguided by business objectives, ethical frameworks, and modern cloud architectures.

We go beyond experimentation:
- We **translate strategy into code**.
- We **integrate AI into business processes**.
- We **build responsible and explainable AI**, not black boxes.

This lab is a growing repository of:
- Working prototypes,
- Ethical governance frameworks,
- Pre-trained agents,
- Tools for AI maturity assessment,
- Modular components for applied automation.

## üß™ Prerequisites & Tech Stack

This repository is vendor-agnostic and modular by design. Depending on the module, you may need:

### üß∞ Languages & Frameworks
- **Python** ‚Äì Core for ML models, data pipelines, and API agents
- **Node.js** ‚Äì For building event-driven integrations and lightweight APIs
- **TypeScript** ‚Äì (Optional) for strongly typed interfaces when working with frontend agents or fullstack prototypes

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud & Infrastructure
- **AWS CLI** ‚Äì To interact with services like Lambda, S3, Bedrock or Step Functions
- **Amazon Bedrock** ‚Äì For serverless access to foundation models (Anthropic Claude, Mistral, etc.)
- **Lambda Functions** ‚Äì Event-driven compute for deploying agents and APIs
- **S3 / DynamoDB / API Gateway** ‚Äì Storage, serverless APIs and metadata management

### ü§ñ LLMs & AI APIs
- **OpenAI API** ‚Äì GPT-4 / GPT-3.5 for generation, embedding, function calling
- **Anthropic Claude** ‚Äì Via Amazon Bedrock
- **HuggingFace Transformers** ‚Äì For model loading, fine-tuning and experimentation
- **Mistral / LLaMA** ‚Äì (Planned) self-hosted or optimized LLMs for private deployments

### üß† AI & ML Toolkits
- **LangChain** ‚Äì For building LLM-powered pipelines and agents (planned)
- **Haystack / RAG** ‚Äì For retrieval-augmented generation workflows
- **scikit-learn** ‚Äì Classical ML models for classification and experimentation
- **Pandas / NumPy / Matplotlib** ‚Äì Data analysis and exploration

### üîê Security & Governance
- **IAM roles and policies** (AWS) ‚Äì To manage access control securely
- **Ethical AI Framework** ‚Äì Custom-built framework based on NIST, GDPR, and Latin American regulations
- **AI Fairness 360 (IBM)** ‚Äì (Optional) Bias detection and mitigation

### üß™ Experimentation & Deployment
- **Jupyter Notebooks** ‚Äì For prototyping and demos
- **Postman / Insomnia** ‚Äì For API testing
- **Docker** ‚Äì (Optional) Local containerized dev environments
